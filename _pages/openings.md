Other opportunities are available through the [Commonwealth Scholarship](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-phd-scholarships-for-least-developed-countries-and-fragile-states/)  (deadline: usually October) and James Watt Scholarships (deadline: usually June).**

Applicants must have a UK first-class honours degree, or its international equivalent, in an appropriate subject; or a UK 2:1 honours degree plus a UK Master’s degree, or their international equivalents; or relevant qualifications and experience. 

All applicants to the University will be asked to demonstrate a level of English language competency, regardless of their nationality or country of residence. We accept a wide range of international English qualifications and English language tests.
